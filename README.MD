# Micro-Service

## Introduction

Seed app for creating opinionated micro-services that use Cockroach/PostgresSQL
for storage and either:
1. the `micro api` for load balancing via the proxy handler
    
    or
2. Google App Engine

## Installation

Note: One can use the installer
[here](https://github.com/tomogoma/repo-installer) to install all the
dependencies together with the micro-service by configuring using the
provided installer links.

### Pre-requisites

#### Using micro

1. A [cockroachdb](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) instance for
persistance. A systemd installer can be found here:
https://github.com/tomogoma/cockroach-installer
1. [consul](https://www.consul.io/) for service discovery. A systemd
installer can be found here:
https://github.com/tomogoma/consul-installer
1. [micro](https://github.com/micro/micro) as a gateway and load balancer.
A systemd installer can be found here:
https://github.com/tomogoma/micro-installer

## Installation and Uninstallation using micro

1. clone the repository and `cd` into it
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/tomogoma/name
    cd authms
    ```
    The app can either be installed or
    [run directly](#running-the-micro-service).
1. install (Systemd only)
    ```
    make install
    ```
1. uninstall (Systemd only)
    ```
    make uninstall
    ```
    
## Manual build

[Go](https://golang.org) 1.7+ is required for this.

To run a manual build either:
1. Run the build command from inside the root folder:
    ```
    make build
    ```
    `make build` can also be supplied with `goos=[GOOS]` `goarch=[GOARCH]`
    `goarm=[GOARM]` values as per the documentation at https://golang.org/cmd/go
    
    or 
1. Run the build.go file directly
    ```
    go run build.go --help // to show all options for building
    ```

## Configuration and deployment

### Configuring the service

Edit the configuration file. It is located at
`/etc/name/name<version>.conf.yml` and is documented for required
values.

### Running the Micro-Service

This section will be managed by systemd if the respective installers were
used.

1. Make sure CockroachDB is running
    - Lack or misconfiguration of this will not stop the micro-service
     from starting, but requests will yield internal server errors until
     a connection to the db is established.
1. Start consul
1. Start micro (api, web or both)
    1. Start micro api if planning to use RPC communication between the
    gateway and the micro-service while maintaining http communication
    between the clients and the gateway.
        ```
        micro api
        ```
        More here:
        https://github.com/micro/examples/tree/master/greeter#sidecar
    1. Start micro web if planning to use http between all components.
        ```
        micro web
        ```
        More here:
        https://github.com/micro/examples/tree/master/greeter#web
1. Start the micro-service
    1. Using systemd after installation:
        ```
        sudo systemctl start name<version>
        ```
    1. Running directly from the repo folder
       ```
       cd bin
       ./app
       ```
    1. Using the go toolchain e.g.
        ```
        go build
        ```
        or
        ```
        go install
        ```

### Accessing the Authentication Services

`micro` is the recommended gateway for accessing the micro-service.

`micro web` runs on port `8082` by default

`micro api` runs on port `8080` by default

These options can be configured:
```
micro --help
```
or
```
micro [option] --help
```

1. Access using `micro web` is direct:
    ```
    http://localhost:8082/authms<version>/...
    ```
1. Access using `micro api` has to be through POST methods e.g. (with curl):
   ```
   curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}' http://localhost:8080/authms<version>/AuthMS/...
   ```
